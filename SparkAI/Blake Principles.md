00:00:00.120 how do you design a viral
00:00:05.319 app my name is Blake Anderson in one
00:00:08.000 year I built three viral apps that have
00:00:10.000 each generated millions in profit Riz
00:00:12.360 GPT umax and CI I'm going to be sharing
00:00:15.879 my exact process with you guys during
00:00:18.039 this five-part series which is brought
00:00:20.199 to you by Apex our mission is to produce
00:00:22.880 highquality tools and content designed
00:00:24.920 to improve your health success and
00:00:26.880 purpose in life now onto designing a vir
00:00:30.240 app let's first Define the objective of
00:00:32.399 viral app design and explain why it's
00:00:34.680 important viral app design seeks to
00:00:36.559 minimize the friction from design to
00:00:39.120 millions of users we're going to focus
00:00:41.079 on single player utility apps apps that
00:00:43.320 solve a problem in a straightforward
00:00:45.200 Manner and don't require complex social
00:00:47.640 interaction the design is important
00:00:49.640 because it builds off of your idea and
00:00:51.600 sets the stage for building and
00:00:54.239 marketing your app the majority of the
00:00:56.280 success from umax came from the design
00:00:59.120 of one sing sing Le screen the first
00:01:01.239 half of this video is going to be about
00:01:03.199 principles which should shape how you
00:01:05.159 think about design our Three core
00:01:07.360 principles are number one minimize
00:01:09.920 cognitive load number two do not
00:01:12.600 reinvent the wheel and number three
00:01:15.040 think like your customer the second half
00:01:17.360 of the video is about methods which help
00:01:19.479 how you actually design your app our
00:01:22.119 Three core methods are number one learn
00:01:24.960 figma number two create an idea board
00:01:28.040 and number three study the content
00:01:31.320 principle number one minimize cognitive
00:01:34.200 load every tap every decision and every
00:01:37.360 moment of confusion will hinder your
00:01:40.040 app's growth the less your users have to
00:01:42.399 think the more likely they are to get
00:01:44.840 value out of your product Riz GPT
00:01:47.360 contained two buttons upload a
00:01:49.320 screenshot and get pickup lines umax
00:01:52.479 contained one button scan your face Cal
00:01:56.119 also contained one button analyze your
00:01:58.719 food your app does doesn't need every
00:02:00.520 feature imaginable it just needs to get
00:02:02.880 the core action done well if it's too
00:02:05.600 complicated for a 5-year-old to use it
00:02:07.960 you're headed in the wrong direction
00:02:10.199 over time you can improve and add new
00:02:12.200 functionality but when you first launch
00:02:14.720 Keep It lean apply the pedo principle
00:02:17.680 80% of your apps functionality is going
00:02:20.000 to come from 20% of the possible feature
00:02:22.640 set launch with the 20% the most viral
00:02:25.599 apps in history launch with one core
00:02:28.640 action that users really like for Tinder
00:02:31.120 it's swipe right to match for Tik Tok
00:02:33.959 swipe up to get a new video minimize
00:02:36.519 cognitive load and keep it simple
00:02:39.319 principle number two do not reinvent the
00:02:41.879 wheel the hardest part of the app design
00:02:44.159 process is figuring out your initial
00:02:46.200 layout the process of iteration can be
00:02:48.640 absolutely grueling but it's good that
00:02:51.000 successful apps have already figured it
00:02:53.159 out for you you don't have to figure out
00:02:55.040 a novel place to put the settings button
00:02:57.400 everybody has already decided for you
00:02:59.519 that it belongs in the top right your
00:03:01.519 users have learned dozens of apps
00:03:03.400 they've built muscle memory for where
00:03:05.319 things should be and how they should
00:03:06.920 work fighting against these expectations
00:03:09.480 just creates friction for UMX when we
00:03:12.080 came up with the six Factor rating
00:03:13.519 system we drew on inspiration from
00:03:15.799 football player ratings in games like
00:03:17.840 FIFA and Madden if your app is
00:03:20.200 differentiated enough in functionality
00:03:22.440 you don't need to seriously
00:03:24.040 differentiate yourself in design save
00:03:26.319 your Innovation for solving the core
00:03:28.560 problem for everything else follow
00:03:30.760 standard practice principle number three
00:03:33.480 think like your customer the biggest
00:03:35.680 mistake I see Founders making is
00:03:37.840 designing for Imaginary users with Cal I
00:03:41.599 had used my fitness pal and other
00:03:43.680 calorie trackers in the past I knew what
00:03:46.000 sort of functionality people wanted
00:03:47.959 instead on the other hand when I was
00:03:49.799 building umax I really had no idea what
00:03:52.239 looks maxing was so I joined the Discord
00:03:54.799 servers I watched the content and I read
00:03:57.159 the forums turned out it was mostly just
00:03:59.519 about about skin care hair care and
00:04:01.360 being healthy this isn't just about
00:04:03.079 market research this is about becoming
00:04:05.360 your customer you'll start seeing your
00:04:07.239 own app through their eyes you stop
00:04:09.200 thinking about cool features and you
00:04:11.000 start thinking about the features that
00:04:13.000 actually solve the problems once again
00:04:15.200 for calii this meant making calorie
00:04:17.519 tracking simpler and faster than ever
00:04:19.918 before for umax this meant simple
00:04:22.000 numeric ratings and recommendations on
00:04:24.360 how to improve ABS that go viral aren't
00:04:26.639 designed in a vacuum they're designed by
00:04:28.880 people that understand their users on a
00:04:31.560 deep almost obsessive level either build
00:04:34.360 for who you are today or become the
00:04:36.600 person that you're building for method
00:04:38.639 number one learn figma I often hear
00:04:41.400 people talking about new design tools
00:04:43.680 and AI design and canva I cannot
00:04:47.000 emphasize this enough stop learn to use
00:04:51.039 figma every single successful app I've
00:04:53.759 seen began in figma if you're already
00:04:56.520 familiar become better the active
00:04:58.759 designing is the most important act in
00:05:01.440 transferring your ideas into something
00:05:03.680 tangible personally I prioritize user
00:05:06.479 experience or ux over user interface or
00:05:10.240 UI what this means is that I'm not
00:05:12.240 overly focused on what the corner radius
00:05:14.560 is or what the gradient overlay looks
00:05:16.880 like I'm more concerned with what the
00:05:19.240 key components do and how they help the
00:05:22.039 user my co-founder design R GPT so the
00:05:25.639 first time I ever designed was when I
00:05:27.560 was building umax I taught myself how to
00:05:30.240 design a functional MVP in just a number
00:05:32.759 of days here's how I would recommend
00:05:34.680 learning First Watch a 1hour basic figma
00:05:37.600 tutorial on YouTube to understand how to
00:05:39.759 use the platform second try redesigning
00:05:42.560 an actual apps interface in figma the
00:05:45.160 goal here isn't to become a professional
00:05:47.000 designer it's to turn your ideas into
00:05:49.680 something tangible as quickly as
00:05:51.720 possible the faster you can test ideas
00:05:54.080 and see what they actually look like the
00:05:56.039 faster you'll be able to iterate to a
00:05:57.919 final product that you're happy with
00:05:59.759 method number two create an idea board
00:06:02.880 this doesn't have to be some fancy mood
00:06:04.639 board this can just be a collection of
00:06:06.400 screenshots from apps with similar
00:06:08.599 functionality for UMX once again this
00:06:11.199 was the Madden and FIFA style rating
00:06:13.840 systems this meant the upload image flow
00:06:16.520 from AI Avatar generators for Cal this
00:06:20.120 was the homepage of every other calorie
00:06:22.759 tracker this is done to look for
00:06:24.599 patterns what works what doesn't what do
00:06:27.199 you like and dislike the key here is to
00:06:29.360 be systematic drawn inspiration from
00:06:31.880 onboarding from settings from homepages
00:06:34.960 from different flows from everything
00:06:36.880 that you can find and everything that
00:06:38.520 you're going to have in your app this
00:06:40.479 will become your reference library
00:06:42.599 anytime you get stuck on a design for an
00:06:44.759 individual component you can reference
00:06:46.720 this one website that I like to use for
00:06:48.919 this is mob.com instead of actually
00:06:51.720 having to download the app and take
00:06:53.360 screenshots you can just copy and paste
00:06:55.599 from mobin and no I am not sponsored I
00:06:59.120 personally still have these idea boards
00:07:01.080 saved and I'll reference them on
00:07:02.879 occasion just to remember what it was
00:07:04.919 like when I was designing the individual
00:07:06.919 app there's a classic saying that great
00:07:08.960 artist steal well here it's that great
00:07:12.120 designer's screenshot method number
00:07:14.440 three study the content as I had
00:07:17.120 mentioned with umax the majority of our
00:07:19.919 success was attributable to our design
00:07:22.919 the design of one screen the Madden or
00:07:26.120 FIFA style rating screen I studied
00:07:28.520 content that went viral on social media
00:07:30.680 and I worked backwards from there with
00:07:32.919 Riz GPT we did something similar we
00:07:35.199 found the style of Riz slideshows that
00:07:37.520 went most viral then we designed screens
00:07:40.319 that would seamlessly integrate into
00:07:42.639 this already existing content when you
00:07:44.840 spent tens or even hundreds of hours
00:07:48.280 studying the content you'll understand
00:07:50.919 what sort of designs are going to do
00:07:52.879 best you'll understand what people want
00:07:55.319 to see and how it can seamlessly
00:07:57.759 integrate into social media content I've
00:08:00.479 referenced this a few times throughout
00:08:02.240 this series but it is of Paramount
00:08:04.400 importance if you don't understand what
00:08:06.720 you're building and who you're building
00:08:08.280 it for it will be extremely difficult to
00:08:11.000 make it go viral you should have social
00:08:13.039 media accounts specifically dedicated to
00:08:15.759 consuming content only in your apps
00:08:18.199 Niche this content will then inform you
00:08:20.800 how to actually design your product and
00:08:23.720 how to design the most viral screens in
00:08:26.280 it hopefully the content in this video
00:08:28.280 will help you design your viral app I'm
00:08:30.840 making many more videos in the future so

# How to IDEATE a Viral App in 2025 (1/5)
# https://www.youtube.com/watch/c1OSGwpKz3o

00:00:00.040 building viral apps in software is the
00:00:02.120 hottest new business Trend my name is
00:00:04.640 Blake Anderson and I'm the first person
00:00:06.640 to build three apps that have each
00:00:08.519 generated millions in downloads and
00:00:10.719 millions in profit in just one year the
00:00:13.040 apps I built are Riz GPT umax and Cal
00:00:16.880 I'm going to share with you guys my
00:00:18.279 exact process during this five-part
00:00:20.519 series which is brought to you by Apex
00:00:23.080 our mission at Apex is to produce
00:00:25.640 highquality tools and content designed
00:00:28.320 to improve your health success and
00:00:30.400 purpose in life I will never sell a
00:00:33.360 course I'm also making many more videos
00:00:35.760 in the future so make sure to subscribe
00:00:38.200 to stay up to date and check out apex.nc
00:00:41.120 to see what we're building the first
00:00:43.200 step to creating a viral app is coming
00:00:45.399 up with a viral idea a viral idea is one
00:00:48.480 that minimizes the amount of friction
00:00:50.600 from inception to millions of users
00:00:53.480 we'll be focusing on single player
00:00:55.199 utility apps apps that don't require
00:00:57.280 some complex backend or social fun
00:01:00.000 functionality the idea is important
00:01:02.199 because it sets the foundation for your
00:01:04.479 design development and distribution if
00:01:07.520 you choose to work on a bad idea you'll
00:01:10.119 waste a lot of time on the other parts
00:01:12.520 for example our execution on Riz GPT was
00:01:16.080 not great at all but we had a viral idea
00:01:19.439 and that made everything else 10 times
00:01:21.280 easier so how do you come up with a
00:01:22.920 viral idea the first half of this video
00:01:25.600 will be about principles that should
00:01:27.680 shape how you think about problems
00:01:30.479 principle number one is to solve big
00:01:33.240 problems number two is that more
00:01:35.920 complicated means less viral and number
00:01:39.399 three is the did you hear about idea but
00:01:42.840 I'll get into that later the second half
00:01:44.920 of this video will be about methods that
00:01:47.320 help you identify the actual problems
00:01:49.680 that you plan to solve method number one
00:01:51.840 is to scan social media number two is to
00:01:55.159 research the App Store and number three
00:01:57.960 is to disconnect principle number one
00:02:00.960 solve big problems people want solutions
00:02:03.719 to big problems that they have think of
00:02:06.320 maso's hierarchy of needs I don't care
00:02:09.360 if you're going to help me feel like I'm
00:02:11.280 part of a group if I don't have food on
00:02:13.920 my table solve the most fundamental
00:02:16.319 problems Riz GPT helps you get more
00:02:19.239 girls umax helps you become more
00:02:22.080 attractive Cal helps you achieve your
00:02:25.000 fitness goals your app doesn't have to
00:02:27.120 be the entirety of the solution but if
00:02:29.920 you frame it as one solution to a big
00:02:33.319 problem that people have it will be
00:02:35.560 significantly more viral than framing it
00:02:38.319 as the full solution to a relatively
00:02:41.080 minor problem the biological imperative
00:02:43.879 asserts that life exists to continue
00:02:46.680 living and to reproduce help people with
00:02:50.080 those things principle number two more
00:02:52.920 complicated means less viral similar to
00:02:56.200 solving big problems you need to do it
00:02:58.599 in simple ways you can frame your
00:03:00.840 product as the solution to getting more
00:03:02.800 girls but if it takes the user 25 steps
00:03:05.959 to get there they won't be very
00:03:07.840 interested virality is contingent on
00:03:10.720 Simplicity you should be able to
00:03:12.360 describe the unique nature of your app
00:03:14.319 in three words R GPT respond to girls
00:03:19.200 umax face analysis CI photo calorie
00:03:24.400 counter it really is that simple the
00:03:27.319 Simplicity matters because it affects
00:03:29.519 every every part of your growth how
00:03:32.159 easily people can understand your app
00:03:34.959 How likely they are to tell their
00:03:36.720 friends about it and most importantly
00:03:40.080 how quickly it can be demonstrated in
00:03:42.439 content think about a Tik Tok video you
00:03:45.159 have maximum 3 seconds to capture the
00:03:48.120 audience's attention if your app's too
00:03:50.519 complicated to do that you're fighting
00:03:52.760 an uphill battle simple Concepts simple
00:03:56.920 execution massive growth principle
00:03:59.840 number three did you hear about this is
00:04:02.799 about making your product remarkable
00:04:05.000 your app needs to be something that
00:04:06.439 people naturally want to tell their
00:04:08.480 friends about did you hear about the AI
00:04:11.680 that can text girls for you did you hear
00:04:14.280 about the app that rates how attractive
00:04:16.519 you are did you hear about the app that
00:04:19.079 lets you count calories just with
00:04:20.918 pictures if you can't fill in that
00:04:22.759 sentence naturally you will struggle
00:04:25.280 with growth look at how people share
00:04:27.199 apps R GPT spread through through
00:04:30.039 screenshots that was posted in Tik Tok
00:04:32.199 content umac spread through people
00:04:34.360 sharing their Transformations their
00:04:36.440 ratings before and after CI spread from
00:04:40.320 people showing off their meals and the
00:04:42.479 macros in it your app needs to create
00:04:45.360 moments worth sharing something that
00:04:47.400 makes people pull their friends aside
00:04:49.240 and say dude have you heard about this
00:04:52.039 think to yourself would somebody bring
00:04:54.120 it up at a party would somebody text
00:04:56.759 their mom about it would somebody send
00:04:59.240 it in their group chat your app needs to
00:05:01.880 make people feel something surprise
00:05:04.840 excitement anger anything but in
00:05:07.759 difference when I first built umax I
00:05:09.840 pulled it out at a party and everybody
00:05:12.479 wanted to find out what they were rated
00:05:14.720 if your app doesn't create these moments
00:05:16.800 keep iterating on the idea until it does
00:05:19.800 the most viral products aren't just
00:05:21.840 useful they are remarkable method number
00:05:25.160 one scan social media this is
00:05:28.199 non-negotiable social media is a
00:05:30.400 manifestation of the collective
00:05:32.319 conscious what are people interested in
00:05:35.039 what are they talking about to my
00:05:36.840 knowledge there's no magic bullet for
00:05:39.039 identifying new trends but some things
00:05:41.479 that I do are I use Google Trends to see
00:05:45.039 what's popping off I explore Reddit
00:05:47.639 communities and I read comment sections
00:05:50.440 of Instagram Tik Tok and other social
00:05:52.919 media platforms if you want to take it
00:05:54.880 to the next level you should create
00:05:57.240 social media accounts and consume
00:05:59.759 content that you previously would never
00:06:01.720 engage with for example if you are a
00:06:04.319 25-year-old guy that watches
00:06:06.280 weightlifting and programming content
00:06:09.160 create a new account and engage with
00:06:11.520 content that a 35-year-old mom would
00:06:14.000 like content about cooking for the
00:06:16.400 family interior design and pickle ball I
00:06:20.120 know it sounds kind of insane but you'll
00:06:22.440 be amazed with parts of the internet
00:06:24.319 that you never knew existed before I
00:06:26.720 built umax I saw one thing about look
00:06:28.960 maxing and pequ my interest so I created
00:06:31.800 accounts and completely dedicated them
00:06:34.440 to consuming looksmaxing content I
00:06:37.160 figured out what forums they lived on
00:06:40.000 and what products they used eventually I
00:06:43.199 discovered exactly what sort of problems
00:06:45.319 these people were having and this
00:06:47.360 enabled me to build a product around it
00:06:49.520 the key here is breaking out of your
00:06:51.199 bubble your feed is naturally an echo
00:06:54.319 chamber of stuff that you're already
00:06:56.160 interested in New Perspectives means new
00:06:59.080 opportun unities means new viral ideas
00:07:03.039 method number two research the App Store
00:07:06.319 researching the app store isn't just
00:07:07.879 about browsing it's about discovering
00:07:10.520 what works and what doesn't download a
00:07:12.720 new app every day watch the content that
00:07:15.319 they're posting on social media and
00:07:17.639 figure out why the app is succeeding or
00:07:20.199 why it's not you can also search up
00:07:22.160 sensor Tower to find out what their
00:07:23.919 monthly downloads and monthly Revenue
00:07:25.879 are this is extremely important because
00:07:28.840 your first first guess of whether or not
00:07:30.800 they're succeeding isn't necessarily
00:07:33.039 right before I built Cal I downloaded
00:07:36.039 every calorie tracker that I could find
00:07:37.879 on the internet and I asked myself is
00:07:40.840 there really opportunity here identify
00:07:43.280 shortcomings and room for improvement if
00:07:45.639 an app idea has been tried 100 times and
00:07:48.879 nobody has succeeded you should probably
00:07:51.360 stay away from the space like social
00:07:53.879 weightlifting apps the first app that I
00:07:56.080 ever tried fell victim to this it was a
00:07:58.800 college Market place if there's a
00:08:00.680 graveyard of failures and no successes
00:08:03.639 avoid the space entirely the goal here
00:08:06.440 is not to copy it's to identify Market
00:08:09.680 gaps and
00:08:10.919 inefficiencies if you can identify a
00:08:13.479 problem across the industry that nobody
00:08:16.000 has solved you might be on to something
00:08:18.840 method number three disconnect the best
00:08:21.879 ideas will not come to you when you're
00:08:24.280 forcing them they come in moments of
00:08:26.720 clarity take long walks no phone no
00:08:30.400 music no nothing I came up with the idea
00:08:33.120 for Riz gbt when I was on a walk home I
00:08:36.719 came up with the idea for umax when I
00:08:38.880 was on a hike your brain needs space to
00:08:41.440 process all the information that you
00:08:43.360 consume on a daily basis going through
00:08:45.959 social media and doing app research are
00:08:48.760 inputs but your mind needs time to come
00:08:51.760 up with the outputs think of your mind
00:08:54.080 like a computer when you're taking in
00:08:56.279 new information you're filling up your
00:08:58.480 memory storage
00:09:00.000 but you need time to clear it out so
00:09:02.000 that you can continue to operate
00:09:03.720 efficiently most Founders are consuming
00:09:05.880 content 24/7 scrolling x.com reading
00:09:09.959 Tech articles and watching Tik toks
00:09:13.120 there's no space for original thought
00:09:15.600 this is why everybody builds the same
00:09:17.680 things they're all consuming the same
00:09:20.200 content everyone saw Chachi BT and
00:09:22.959 immediately built AI chat Bots people
00:09:25.959 saw stable diffusion and built AI Avatar
00:09:28.920 generator
00:09:29.959 the real viral opportunities aren't
00:09:32.360 always obvious they require synthesis
00:09:35.399 great ideas come from connecting the
00:09:37.160 dots that others have not solving male
00:09:39.680 dating frustration with AI led to RIS
00:09:42.519 GPT solving problems in the looks maxing
00:09:45.440 Community with AI Vision led to umax and
00:09:49.000 solving calorie counting friction with
00:09:51.920 once again computer vision led to Cal
00:09:55.440 these connections don't usually happen
00:09:57.399 when you're actively searching for them
00:09:59.440 they happen in the shower on walks
00:10:02.160 during workouts moments of real mental
00:10:05.680 Clarity the greatest Founders aren't
00:10:07.880 necessarily the smartest they're the
00:10:10.160 ones that dare to think differently from
00:10:12.320 the rest hopefully the content in this
00:10:14.800 video will help you come up with your
00:10:16.560 next big idea if you have any questions
